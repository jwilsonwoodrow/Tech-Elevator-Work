# Module 2 Coding Assessment Exercise

The assessment you are about to complete will aid you in validating your understanding of the module 2 objectives:

- SELECT, WHERE, and JOIN statements
- ORDER BY and GROUP BY clauses
- INSERT and UPDATE statements
- DAO methods
- Creating domain objects from SQL data

It will also give you practice with coding assessments you may encounter during the job interview process.

## Overview

This is a time-boxed, individual coding assessment. You will have one hour to complete as much of your assigned problem as you can. You are not expected to complete all features of problem in the time given. Complete as much as you can.

You may use any resource available in the classroom except another Human Being. This is an individual effort.

Whatever you complete should not have compile or run-time errors. Any features you are able to complete should run successfully.

Any unit tests should also be error free and run successfully.

If you are nearing the end of the time-box and you have compile/run-time errors or tests that have compile errors, consider commenting out or removing the code causing the errors before you push your final effort.

At the end of the time-box you should have your final effort pushed to your class repository.

You are expected to remain in the classroom until you have completed the coding assessment.

If you get done before the end of the time-box, please be respectful of those still working. Please leave the classroom if you would like to talk with others that have completed the coding assessment.

## Instructions

1. Pull from your class repository like you do for code every day. The assessment will be in the ```Module-2\Assessment``` folder of your class repo folder.
2. In the ```Assessment``` folder you will see several folders.  **Choose the folder that matches the name you were sent by your instructor**.
3. You should see two folders, a `part-1` and a `part-2`.
4. Begin with `part-1` folder. This section tests your skill with SQL.
    * Open `setup.sql` in SSMS (double-click should do it), and Execute that script to setup your database.  The database will be called assessment.
    * Close `setup.sql`, and then open the `assessment.sql` file in SSMS.
    * Make sure you are Using the `assessment` database.
    * Fill out `assessment.sql` with the correct SQL statements to satisfy the requirements.
    * **Save the `assessment.sql` file in SSMS.  Then close the file.
    * `git add -A` --> `git commit -m"assessment part 1"` --> `git push` your changes. (You can do this again later if you make corrections, but do it *now* to save your work.)
5. `part-2` represents a DAO project that you will finish. 
    * Click on the `.sln` file in the sub-folder to launch the project.
    * Complete the DAO class.
    * Use the unit tests to check the correctness of the methods.
    * `git add -A` --> `git commit -m"assessment part 2"` --> `git push` your changes.

5. **Be sure to push your final effort when you are done or at the end of the time-box**.  Consider going to Bitbucket to verify that you have actually pushed your assessment.
6. Your instructor will let you know when to begin and give you a "10-minute warning" before the end of the time-box.
